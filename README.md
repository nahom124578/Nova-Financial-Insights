# Financial News Sentiment Analysis and Stock Price Correlation

## Overview

This project focuses on the detailed analysis of a large corpus of financial news data to discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. The goal is to refine skills in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) while enhancing predictive analytics capabilities. By performing sentiment analysis on financial news headlines and correlating these sentiments with stock price movements, Nova Financial Solutions aims to boost its financial forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Objectives

As a **Data Analyst** at Nova Financial Solutions, our primary task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the financial news dataset. The focus of our analysis is two-fold:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the financial news headlines.
   - Quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in the headlines using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
   - Derive sentiment scores associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements.
   - Track stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyze the impact of news sentiment on stock performance.
   - If available, consider the publication date and time for more precise analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, converting text to lowercase, and removing unnecessary characters.
   - Extract relevant features, including stock symbols, publication date, and the headline text.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TextBlob or spaCy, to analyze the sentiment of the headlines.
   - Categorize sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral.
   - Assign sentiment scores to each news article.

3. **Stock Price Correlation**:
   - For each news article, retrieve the corresponding stock price data for the publication date.
   - Calculate the percentage change in stock prices from the publication date (and possibly before/after the articleâ€™s release time).
   - Analyze the relationship between sentiment scores and stock price changes using statistical methods like Pearson correlation.

4. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Use the sentiment scores and stock price changes to develop predictive models.
   - Explore machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict future stock price movements based on sentiment data.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Leverage insights from the sentiment analysis and stock price correlation to suggest investment strategies.
   - Provide actionable recommendations on how to use sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.

## Deliverables

- **Sentiment Analysis**: A report summarizing the sentiment scores for each financial news article and the overall sentiment distribution.
- **Correlation Analysis**: A detailed analysis of the statistical correlations between sentiment and stock price movements, including visualizations.
- **Investment Strategies**: Actionable insights and investment strategies based on the sentiment-stock price correlation.
- **Final Report**: A comprehensive report with clear and concise findings, insights, and recommendations for Nova Financial Solutions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **spaCy/TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis and NLP tasks.
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation.
